### Description: A portfolio webapp based on Flask utilizing tailwindcss and daisyUI.



My name is Ashlyn and I'm excited to present my final project for CS50x.  For this project, I decided to create a portfolio, which I wrote in Flask utilizing tailwindcss and daisyUI.

So to get started, I will point out some things that will apply for all pages on the website. As you might notice, the desktop and mobile versions of the site have different layouts. The mobile one has a bottom navigation bar, and two icons in the top corners for other less used parts of the website. Last but not least, there is also a footer located at the bottom of each page.

Now for the homepage, the homepage features a photo of me, a brief sentence or two about myself, and a *hopefully* accurate timeline for my programming future. 

Moving over to the Projects page, which you can access either by clicking on view projects, the code icon in the bottom navigation bar on mobile, or the corresponding link in the footer, you can see the featured projects per each type of project. 

The projects displayed here are imported from a project_name.md file into a sequal database based upon the content in each line of the file. If you want to see more projects for a given language, you can click the button below the featured projects, which will then display all projects of that language.

If someone needs to contact me though, they can find all the information they need to in the contact me page of the website. It has a button to email me as well as various social medias I can be found on. You can also click the resume button with the indeed icon at the top of the website at anytime to see my resume.

If someone happens to get drastically lost or sent the wrong link for the website, they will find themselves at this error page.

Lastly, my favorite part of the website. The page dedicated to my lovely cat cali, now in a masonry grid.
And I guess it would be a shame if I didn't say it once. this was cs50.
