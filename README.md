### Description: A portfolio webapp based on Flask utilizing tailwindcss and daisyUI.

My name is Ashlyn and I'm excited to present my final project for CS50x.  For this project, I decided to create a portfolio, which I wrote in Flask utilizing tailwindcss and daisyUI.

So to get started, I will point out some things that will apply for all pages on the website. As you might notice, the desktop and mobile versions of the site have different layouts. The mobile one has a bottom navigation bar, and two icons in the top corners for other less used parts of the website. Last but not least, there is also a footer located at the bottom of each page.

Now for the homepage, the homepage features a photo of me, a brief sentence or two about myself, and a *hopefully* accurate timeline for my programming future. 

Moving over to the Projects page, which you can access either by clicking on view projects, the code icon in the bottom navigation bar on mobile, or the corresponding link in the footer, you can see

And I guess I should make sure to say, this was cs50.
